## Using CRAFT on IAM dataset
In order to create more variability for our model, we sought for more handwritten characters datasets but found very few resources. We did find some, but they were in other languages. In order to solve this problem, we resorted to using CRAFT to extract characters from images of handwritten words. We chose the IAM dataset to perform this task on.

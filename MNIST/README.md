## MNIST Recognition using CNN Keras
This is a simple MNIST model using Keras CNN. The original neural network was acquired from Coursera, but I have added little changes to the network using the same architecture of LeNet5 and a few additional layers. 

The performance is worse than the original neural network despite the improvements. However, bigger dataset will be tested in the future in order to maximize the efficiency of the CNN using data augmentation. At the moment, the accuracy of the model is at 99.6599%. 

### Files

### Model and Weights
Haven't saved the model and its weights in seperate files.

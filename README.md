## OCR-Dev
A small computer vision project in the making. The goal is to create a simple website that implements CNN Keras model to recognize handwritten characters (letters and digits) from an input file (a photo, image, or a scanned file). Beside CNN Keras, we are also using CRAFT (Character-Region Awareness For Text detection) in Pytorch. The point is to run our model on seperate character. 

## Process
- We used the popular MNIST dataset with over 60k images of handwritten digits to practice using CNN in Keras. 
- Developed a more complexed CNN model on EMNIST (Extended-MNIST) dataset that returns 91.30% accuracy in the testing dataset.
- Working on CRAFT.
